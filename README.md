Graduate School Project - Using Figma and Fundamentals of Software Engineering

Project Description:

Part-time and full-time musicians face many struggles with coordination and availability beyond existing limited social circles. With this software, we want to alleviate the musician’s pains by allowing him/her to connect with other like-minded musicians and form jam sessions that work around his/her lifestyle. This software targets adult musicians of any skill range seeking to coordinate with and meet other musicians for jam sessions. Musicians who are actively looking for others to play with are currently stuck with options such as asking friends and acquaintances or posting ads on social media and at music stores. These choices leave musicians limited to a small circle of those directly around them. Another issue musicians face is the time and effort spent finding someone who plays a particular instrument or a potential band member that fits their desired criteria. It can also be difficult for new locals, beginner instrumentalists, or those who don’t want to commit long term to a group to find other musicians to meet and play with. This software will be able to easily allow musicians to input their information, create sessions with their desired criteria, and look at others’ individual profiles and jam sessions within their preferred distance and location.
